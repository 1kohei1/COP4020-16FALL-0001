--  Problem 1

--  a)   filerFirst - Removes the first element of xs which does not satisfy the property p

filterFirst p [] = []

    | p x = x : filterFirst p xs

--  c)  split - split a list into two lists, picking elements alternately

-- d)   interleave - Creates a list composed of alternatively selected elements from two lists

-- f)   mergeSort - Sorts a list by slpitting it into individual elements and then merging them tro produce a sorted list

mergeSort arr = merge (leftSorted, rightSorted)     -- Merge them back here
